%\subsection{Extending the Sharing of Bandwidth to the Sharing of Computing Resources}

Community networking~\cite{Braem2013} is a shared communication infrastructure in which citizens build and own open communication networks, using mostly wireless but also optical fibre links. 
%Most of these community networks are based on Wi-Fi technology such as ad-hoc networks or IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n access points in the first hop and long-distance point-to-point Wi-Fi links for the trunk network.
%There are several large community networks in Europe, having from 500 to 20,000 nodes, such as 
%	Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network (AWMN), 
%	Freifunk,
%	FunkFeuer,
%	Guifi.net,
%	Ninux,
%and many others worldwide.

Community networks are already based on the principle of sharing, though only of bandwidth, but the social aspects and community nature makes it easier to extend this sharing to other computing resources~\cite{Khan2015Incentive}.
%~\cite{Khan2013Clouds, Jimenez2013, Jimenez2014, Selimi2014TowardsApplication, Selimi2014Distributed, Selimi2014Experiences, Liu2014, Selimi2014Cloud}.
%However, challenges peculiar to such networks are limited, unstable and variable network bandwidth and high churn of nodes.
The strong sense of community and technical knowledge of participants of such networks are some strong points which are conducive to building cloud applications tailored to local needs built on infrastructure provided by the community members.
% \cite{Khan2014Sparks,Khan2014Architecture,Khan2014Macroeconomic}.
For example, Guifi.net community network
%Guifi.net, one of the largest community networks in the world with more than 2800 nodes, 
has deployed community edge cloud using their Debian-based Cloudy distribution~\cite{Baig2015Community}.

%The community network clouds need to address the conditions of community networks and satisfy their requirements.
%We look at the different aspects of designing community cloud systems and the challenges involved below. %, and discuss the related work.
