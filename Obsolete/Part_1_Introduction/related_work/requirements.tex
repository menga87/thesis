%\label{sec:requirements}
%
%A community cloud is a cloud infrastructure which is run and managed independently by various community members.
%%A community cloud is a combination of a number of cloud systems running independently by the different community members. 
%%The capacity and quality of resources available at each individual cloud can vary a lot. 
%In community clouds, resource distribution is very different from the existing commercial public clouds which are deployed on data centres using clusters of mostly homogeneous computers. 
%It is also different from private and hybrid clouds where resources, though not as abundant as data centres, are still consolidated into larger entities.
%%In contrast, in community clouds, there may be tens or even hundreds of sites, but each site may only consist a few tens of machines.

%\subsubsection{Key Requirements}
%%The following requirements provide the foundation for the design of the community cloud system, that need to be satisfied for it to be deployed and adopted successfully by the community.
%
%We consider the following requirements to be a foundation and guideline for the design of the community cloud system, and
%we believe that, if addressed, among other challenges, these requirements can largely provide a cloud system that is deployed and adopted successfully by the community.

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Autonomy
%	\item Security
%	\item Self-Management
%	\item Utility
%	\item Ease of Use
%	\item Incentives for Contribution
%	\item Social and Economic Mechanisms %in community's context
%	\item Support for Heterogeneity
%	\item Standard Middleware Interfaces
%	\item QoS and SLA Guarantees
%\end{itemize}
