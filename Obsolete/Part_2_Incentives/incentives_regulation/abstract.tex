%Community networks are a successful example of a collective where communities operate ICT infrastructure based on the principle of reciprocal sharing of network bandwidth.
%Cloud computing, common in today's Internet, has however not materialised within community networks.
%We analyse in this paper socio-technical characteristics of community networks in order to derive scenarios for community clouds. 
%Based on an architecture for such a community cloud, we implement a prototype for the incentive-driven resource assignment component and evaluate its behaviour experimentally. 
%In simulations of large scale community cloud scenarios we study the behaviour of the incentive mechanism in different configurations.
%Our evaluation gives insight into how the developed mechanisms regulate the consumption of cloud resources. 
%Our results suggest a further integration of this regulation component into current cloud management platforms in order to open them up for the operation of an ecosystem of collaborative cloud services in community networks.
