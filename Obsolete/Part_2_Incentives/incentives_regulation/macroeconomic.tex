%\label{sec:economic-mechanisms}

%The purpose of economic mechanisms and social and psychological incentives is to 
%let the community cloud transition from inception through early adoption to finally ubiquitous usage~\cite{Khan2014Macroeconomic}.
%Such mechanisms must take into account the costs and benefits involved in participating in community cloud.
%For instance, the initial costs for setting up nodes in the community cloud involve hardware costs including the price of the computing and networking equipment, and installation costs including the manual labour needed.
%Besides these costs at the individual level, there are also the transaction costs or management overheads to direct the group coordination and collaborative production efforts necessary for the operation of community cloud.
%%
%The individuals in community cloud act as private enterprises where they offer services to generate revenue. 
%The revenue for the community cloud users include tangible benefits like the services and applications that they will be able to consume, and intangible benefits like the sense of belonging to the community and personal satisfaction because of their contributions.
%The services can range from infrastructure to platform to software services meeting a spectrum of different needs of the users.
%
%Different policies addressing relevant issues of the technical, social, economic and legal aspects of the community cloud are designed to encourage collaboration, 
%for example commons license and peering agreements can be implemented that extend the idea of reciprocal sharing 
%from Wireless Commons License~\cite{WCL2010} 
%and Pico Peering Agreement~\cite{PicoPeering2005}
%in community networks.
%The social context of community networks provides opportunity to harness social capital and the different roles of social relationships.
%Similarly, 
%	lowering transaction costs and entry barriers, 
%	facilitating participation of developers, 
%	exploring different service models to provide value addition and differentiation,
%	and taking advantage of locality and overlay topology of the network
%can prove useful.
%Such mechanisms help adapt the ecosystem of community cloud infrastructure and services to the aspirations of the community network members.
