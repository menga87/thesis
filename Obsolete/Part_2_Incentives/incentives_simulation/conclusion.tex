Community clouds are motivated by the additional value they would bring to community networks. 
Deploying applications in community clouds will boost the usage and spread of the community network model as ICT infrastructure for society. 
This paper builds upon the topology of community networks to derive two community cloud scenarios, local community cloud and federated community cloud. 
A community cloud architecture is then proposed which fits into these scenarios. 
The need for an incentive mechanism in order to community clouds to happen is stated, since for the contribution of any resources the motivation of the users is needed. 
This incentive mechanism is specified and implemented in a simulator in order to be able to perform assessments for large scale scenarios. 
With simulation experiments we characterised the behaviour of different settings of the incentive mechanism and evaluated the success ratio of nodes and resource utilisation. 
A deeper analysis of the behaviour allowed us to better understand the influence of the different configuration options. 
The incentive mechanism has been designed and evaluated taking into account the conditions of community networks. 
Therefore, we expect our results to be transferable to a prototype of a real community cloud system.
