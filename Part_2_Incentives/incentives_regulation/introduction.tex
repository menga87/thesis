Community networks are an ecosystem which is able to regulate and maintain itself, some of the community networks are there for even more than a decade. 
We argue that community cloud, a cloud infrastructure formed by community-owned computing and communication resources, 
has many technical and social challenges so that the main drivers of today's contribution to community networks, 
volunteer and altruistic behaviour, are not enough to successfully overcome these barriers. 
Our hypothesis is that for community cloud to happen, the  members' technical and human contribution needed for such a cloud, 
needs to be steered by incentive mechanisms that pay back the users' contribution with a better quality of experience for them.

In this chapter, we study an incentive mechanism for clouds in community networks, 
keeping in view the key characteristics of community networks 
and the scenarios we foresee for community clouds. 
This incentive mechanism is inspired by Parecon economic model~\cite{Albert2004Parecon, Rahman2010, Vega2013Sharing},
and is based on the idea of effort of each participant, which we define as her contribution relative to her capacity.
Our approach is to do the evaluation with simulation experiments and a prototype, 
which allows us to derive additional conclusions regarding its feasibility for implementation and deployment on a wider scale.
