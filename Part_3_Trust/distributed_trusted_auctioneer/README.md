A Distributed Auctioneer for Resource Allocation in Decentralized Systems
================================

Community wireless mesh networks represent a successful case of collaboration where communities build and operate an open and shared communication infrastructure, based on the principle of voluntary reciprocal sharing of network bandwidth. These are prone to issues of overuse, free-riding and under-provisioning because of the tragedy of commons. However, the social institutions inherent in such community networks ensure their sustainability, such that many community networks have been around for more than a decade and comprise of more than 28,000 nodes. Internet access is often considered the main service of community networks, but the provision of services of local interest within the network is a unique opportunity for community networks, which is currently predominantly unexplored. The consolidation of today's cloud technologies offers community networks the possibility to collectively build community clouds, building upon user-provided networks, and extending towards an ecosystem of cloud services. Realising community network clouds requires reserving bandwidth for cloud services in such a non-cooperative multi-hop wireless network. We propose a distributed auction-based scheduling algorithm extending the idea of proportional fairness pricing to allocate network bandwidth. We want to maximise social good, ensuring efficient use of network resources and fairness among users, and the revenue of the service provider.
