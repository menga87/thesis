\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec__problem_statement}

The problem of allocating shared resources efficiently and effectively is a challenging one,
with the need to provide various guarantees like
	to have maximal social welfare (better utility for all the participants),
	to ensure truthfulness from the users (so they do not have incentives to lie about their requests),
	and, at the same time, to be computationally efficient.
This is particularly important in the case of community network clouds where there is no centralised entity
responsible and in control of all the resources available in the community network.

\emph{
The main objective of this thesis is to develop resource regulation mechanisms 
	to incentivise contribution 
	and maximise the utility of the community cloud system,
	while guaranteeing trust and ensuring truthfulness from its participants.
