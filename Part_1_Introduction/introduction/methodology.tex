\section{Research Methodology}
\label{sec__methodology}

The aim of this thesis is to devise practical and effective incentive mechanisms for community network clouds,
and we approach this mainly by the following means:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Theoretical proofs}. We theoretically prove the soundness of our proposed framework.
	
	\item \textbf{Simulation evaluation}. We conduct simulation experiments, to better understand the behaviour of our mechanisms at scale, and to demonstrate their applicability.
	
	\item \textbf{Prototype deployment}. We implement and deploy prototype components in a testbed, to get insights within the real-world constraints of the community networks.
	
\end{itemize}
