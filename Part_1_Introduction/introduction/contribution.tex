\section{Summary of Contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}

The contributions of this thesis include:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item For local communities of trusted users, this thesis proposes incentive-based resource regulation mechanisms.
	These mechanisms are computationally efficient and incur minimal overhead,
	and ensure contribution from the participants for the viability of the community cloud system.

	\item For a community of untrusted users, this thesis proposes distributed virtual auctioneer 
	using a novel distributed framework for devising Nash equilibria 
	distributed simulations of the auctioneer that are resilient to asynchrony and coalitions. 
	This can be used as a building block to implement resource allocation in a decentralised community cloud system.

\end{enumerate}
