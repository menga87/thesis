Exploring Community Clouds at the Edge in Community Networks and Beyond
================================

###Abstract
Cloud computing promises access to computing resources that is cost-effective, elastic and easily scalable. With few key cloud providers in the field, despite the benefits there are issues like vendor lock-in, privacy and control over data. In this paper we focus at alternative models of cloud computing, like the community clouds at the edge which use resources contributed by individual users by either solely relying on user machines or using them to augment existing cloud infrastructures. We describe an operational geographically distributed and heterogeneous cloud infrastructure with services and applications deployed in the Guifi community network. The presented cloud is a particular case of a community cloud, developed according to the specific needs and conditions of community networks. We study community network clouds in the context of other initiatives in community cloud computing, mobile cloud computing, social cloud computing, and voluntary computing, and analyse how the context of community networks can support the community clouds and what are the research challenges.
