The area of community cloud builds on a vast body of research in peer-to-peer and edge computing research, and the various lessons learnt from the successes and the failures of many P2P applications.
We see a huge opportunity in extending this work for building the core community cloud services that drive innovation in many related areas, and not just the edge computing.
The determinant of this success will not be just the technical sophistication with which the research challenges and open problems are solved,
but also by how well the enthusiasts of the community cloud succeed in capturing the imagination and meeting the expectations of the end users.
